# SobStory is an app where users can track their sobs.
# It was created during the 2023 Tartan Hacks hackathon by Sara Pavlinek, Caroline Shi, Annie Wang, and Doris Wang
# To run the project, simply run the "main.py" file

# Rationale: With the recent boom in mental health advocacy and wellness, there is a lot of importance placed on being vocal about struggling so that others know that they are not alone. This app provides a way for users to disrupt the social norm by sharing their experiences.

# Features: logging sobs, auto-generated statistics of sobs (reasons, yearly overview), resources to access (including a disco dance party!), social connection with other users, custom settings, and more!
